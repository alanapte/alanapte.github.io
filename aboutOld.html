                <p class="firstp">Hey, I'm Alan! I'm currently a Junior at University of California, San Diego
                    working towards my B.S. in Computer Science. I'm a very interdiscplinary student. With an A.S. in Computer Programming
                    and an A.A. in Liberal Arts, Business Emphasis, I like to think about how computer science affects all regions of academia.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to computer science, I'm heavily interested in marketing, design, and management, often trying to understand
                    how these topics have resulted in the success/failure of popular products and companies. Why do so many people use Uber over Lyft?
                    Why did MySpace fail while FaceBook boomed? These are the types of questions that I love about computer science's intersection
                    with the world.
                </p>
                <p class="lastp">In my free time, I always try keep busy. Whether it's learning new songs on the guitar and piano or creating zany Snapchat Lenses (small flex,
                    I have over 40 million views on my Lenses!!), you'll never find me idle for long. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me!
